### Workflow Mapping: CONS_CSV_DNTL_CLMDTL_HX_BR2

This mapping outlines the flow of the data workflow, indicating where the process **starts**, the key intermediate stages, and where it **ends**.

#### Start:
- **Source: V0S77P1 (TGT SeqNo)**
  - Initial data ingestion point.
  - This component starts the process with a target sequence number.

#### Step 1: Join Operation
- **JOIN between V0S77P1 and V0S69**
  - V0S69 is an inner join operation using data from V0S77P1.
  - Data flows from V0S77P1 to V0S69.

#### Step 2: Reformat and Adaptation
- **Reformat (RFMT) applied at V0S49P2**
- **Adaptor V0S48P3** connects to dataset **DS DENTAL CLMDTL HX INS**
  - Data moves through adaptor to reformat dental claim detail history input.
  
---

#### Step 3: Output and Further Processing
- **Output Table: DS CONS CSV DENTAL CLMDTL HX (via V0S67)**
  - Following adaptation and reformatting, data lands into this consolidated dental claim detail history dataset.

#### Step 4: Sorting and Key Generation Stages
- **V0S48P1: Sort & XFM Key Generation**
  - Partition by Key-1.
  - Data flows from DS CONS CSV DENTAL CLMDTL HX output to this step.
  
- **V0S48: Additional Transform & Partition**
  - Partition by Key-2.
  - Further transformation and partitioning after sort/key gen.

- **V0S69P2: Sort & Join (S Inner Join)**
  - Data flows through a sorting and inner join stage.
  
- **V0S69P4: Final Sort & Join**
  - Partition by Key-3.
  - Final sorting and joining step before concluding the process.

#### End:
- The workflow concludes at the output of **V0S69P4**, which is the last sorting and join operation in the chain.
